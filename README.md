Project: "JavaScript Learning Journey"

Description: |
  This repository documents my daily progress while learning JavaScript.
  Each day I practice new concepts and commit my code with a consistent format.

Daily_progress:
  - Day: 1
    topics:
      - Variables
      - Datatypes
      - Type Conversions

commit_convention:
  format: "<type>(<scope>): <short summary>"
  types:
    feat: "A new feature or concept learned"
    fix: "Bug fix or correction"
    docs: "Documentation changes (e.g., README updates)"
    refactor: "Code improvements without changing behavior"
    test: "Adding or updating tests"
    chore: "Maintenance tasks"
  examples:
    - "feat(js): add basics - variables, datatypes, and type conversions"
    - "docs(readme): add commit convention guidelines"

usage:
  steps:
    - "Clone the repo"
    - "Run files with Node.js: node 01_Variables.js"

goal: 
  By the end of this journey, I aim to master JavaScript fundamentals 
  and build real-world projects.
